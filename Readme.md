Game Project: CPSC Python
============

This is a short game made for the final project in my CPSC Python course.

Characters:
============

Demon: This is the player model that the user controls with left right and space.
Knight: Level one enemies that walk toward the player.
Duck: Level two enemies that rain from the sky.
Bird: Level one creatures that fly through the forest but are harmless.

How to Play.
============
Controls: Move left with 'a' or 'left arrow'. Move right with 'd' or 'right arrow'. Attack by holding down 'spacebar'.

Level 1: The user must kill all of the enemies on the right side of the stage. The enemies are moving toward the player. Hold down spacebar to attack.

Level 2: The user must make it to the treasure chest on the far right of the level. Once they make contact with the chest they win.
